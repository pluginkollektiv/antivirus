Security plugin to protect your blog or website against exploits and spam injections.

## Description ##
*AntiVirus for WordPress* is a easy-to-use, safe tool to harden your WordPress site against exploits, malware and spam injections.
You can configure *AntiVirus* to perform an automated daily scan of your theme files and database tables. If the plugin happens to detect any suspicious code injections, it will send out a notification to a previously configured e-mail address.

In case your WordPress site has been hacked, *AntiVirus* will help you to become aware of the problem very quickly in order for you to take immediate action.

### Features ###
* Virus alert in the admin bar
* Cleaning up after plugin removal
* Daily scan with email notifications
* Database tables and theme templates checks
* Whitelist solution: Mark suspected cases as "no virus"
* Manual check of template files with alerts on suspected cases
* Optional: Google Safe Browsing for malware and phishing monitoring.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Will AntiVirus protect my site from being hacked? ###
Not literally "protect from". The plugin’s purpose is to *detect* any "hack" that has already happened and enable you to take immediate action upon it.

A complete documentation is available in the [GitHub repository Wiki](https://github.com/pluginkollektiv/antivirus/wiki).
