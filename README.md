Security plugin to protect your blog or website against exploits and spam injections.

## Description ##
*AntiVirus* is an easy-to-use, safe tool to harden your WordPress site against exploits, malware and spam injections.
You can configure *AntiVirus* to perform an automated daily scan of your theme files. If the plugin detects any suspicious code injections, it will send out a notification to a previously configured e-mail address.

In case your WordPress site has been hacked, *AntiVirus* will help you to become aware of the problem very quickly in order for you to take immediate action.

### Features ###
* Scan for suspicious code in the theme files (daily scan with email notifications and manual scan) with an option to mark detected cases as false positive
* Checksum verification for WordPress Core files
* Optional: Google Safe Browsing for malware and phishing monitoring.

A complete documentation is available on the [AntiVirus website](https://antivirus.pluginkollektiv.org/documentation/).
